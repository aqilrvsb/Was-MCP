**Latest Feature: Proper Device Status Update Implementation**

## üöÄ Latest Updates:

### Device Status Update Fix (June 25, 2025 - 12:30 AM)
- **Proper Device Tracking Implementation**:
  - Added connection session tracking system
  - Device ID is now passed from frontend to backend
  - Connection sessions map device IDs to WhatsApp connections
  - Device status properly updates to "online" after successful connection
- **Database Integration**:
  - UpdateDeviceStatus() properly updates device record
  - Phone number and JID saved to database
  - Last seen timestamp updated
  - No more temporary solutions - real data only!
- **Connection Flow**:
  1. User clicks QR code ‚Üí Device ID sent to backend
  2. Backend tracks session with StartConnectionSession()
  3. WhatsApp pairs ‚Üí PairSuccess event
  4. WhatsApp connects ‚Üí Connected event
  5. Backend updates device status to "online" in database
