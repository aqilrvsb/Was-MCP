## üìß Message Sequences Feature (Updated June 27, 2025)

### What are Sequences?
Multi-project marketing campaigns with automated message delivery. Each sequence is a project (e.g., "Promo Merdeka", "Promosi Hari Raya") with multi-day templates where each contact maintains their own progress timeline.

### Key Features
1. **Project-Based Campaigns**: Create named marketing projects
2. **Multi-Day Templates**: Define 5+ day message sequences
3. **Individual Progress**: Each lead starts from Day 1 when enrolled
4. **Niche-Based Auto-Enrollment**: Automatically add matching leads
5. **Multiple Active Projects**: Leads can be in multiple sequences
6. **Cross-Device Support**: Works across all user devices
7. **Rate Limiting**: Per-device min/max delays prevent bans
8. **Analytics**: Track success/failure rates per project

### How it Works
1. **Create Project Sequence**: 
   - Name your campaign (e.g., "Promo Merdeka")
   - Set target niche
   - Define daily messages with delays

2. **Lead Enrollment**:
   - Manual: Add specific phone numbers
   - Automatic: All leads matching niche

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Each lead maintains individual timeline
   - Ali: Day 3 of "Promo Merdeka", Day 1 of "Hari Raya"
   - New leads always start at Day 1

4. **Message Delivery**:
   - Daily processing at scheduled times
   - Random delays between messages
   - Next day = 24 hours after previous

### Example Projects

**Promo Merdeka Sequence** (5 days):
```
Day 1: Selamat Hari Merdeka! Special 17% discount... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 2: Flash sale continues! Check our products... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 3: Customer testimonials from last year... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 4: Only 2 days left for Merdeka promo... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 5: Last day! Promo ends at midnight... [10-20 sec delay]
```

**Promosi Hari Raya Sequence** (7 days):
```
Day 1: Ramadan Kareem! Early bird Raya collection... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 2: New arrivals for your Raya celebration... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 3: Exclusive designs now available... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 4: Free delivery for orders above RM100... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 5: Limited stock warning - popular items... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 6: Final week before Raya - order now... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 7: Express delivery still available! [15-30 sec delay]
```

## üöÄ Broadcast System Architecture

### Optimized for 200 Users √ó 15 Devices = 3,000+ Connections

### User Isolation & Multi-Device Distribution
- **Complete User Isolation**: Each user's campaigns and sequences ONLY use their own connected devices
- **Example**: 
  - User A creates "Promo Merdeka" campaign ‚Üí Uses ONLY User A's 15 connected devices
  - User B creates "Hari Raya" campaign ‚Üí Uses ONLY User B's 15 connected devices
  - No cross-user device sharing for security and privacy
- **Automatic Load Balancing**: Messages are distributed across all user's connected devices
- **Device Selection**: Round-robin or random selection from user's device pool
- **Failover**: If some devices disconnect, system automatically uses remaining connected devices

### Campaign & Sequence Triggers
- **Campaign Triggers**: Run every minute to check for scheduled campaigns
  - Checks campaign date and time
  - Gets all leads matching campaign niche
  - Distributes messages across ALL user's connected devices
  - Updates campaign status to "sent" when complete
- **Sequence Triggers**: Process new leads and daily messages
  - Auto-enrolls new leads based on niche matching
  - Sends daily messages at scheduled times
  - Each contact progresses individually through sequence

### Device Workers
- **Individual Workers**: Each device has its own dedicated worker thread
- **Simultaneous Operation**: All device workers run in parallel
- **Example**: User A with 15 devices = 15 workers running simultaneously
- **Independent Processing**: Each worker:
  - Has its own message queue (1000 buffer)
  - Processes messages independently
  - Uses device-specific min/max delays
  - No waiting for other devices
- **Parallel Processing**: Up to 100 concurrent workers system-wide
- **Custom Rate Limiting**: Each device has min/max delay settings
- **Health Monitoring**: Auto-restart stuck workers

### Message Flow
1. **Campaign/Sequence Trigger** ‚Üí Message created in database
2. **Broadcast Manager** ‚Üí Routes message to appropriate device worker
3. **Device Worker** ‚Üí Queues message with rate limiting
4. **WhatsApp Send** ‚Üí Message sent with random delay
5. **Status Update** ‚Üí Database updated with result

### Performance Features
- **Sharded Architecture**: Distributes load across devices
- **Message Buffering**: Prevents overwhelming WhatsApp
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database usage
- **In-Memory Queues**: Fast message processing
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed messages retry with backoff

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```
Per Device Settings:
- Min Delay: 5-10 seconds (configurable)
- Max Delay: 15-30 seconds (configurable)
- Random delay between min/max for each message
- Prevents pattern detection and bans
```

### Scaling Guidelines
- **Small (< 500 devices)**: 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- **Medium (500-2000 devices)**: 4GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
- **Large (2000-5000 devices)**: 8GB RAM, 8 CPU cores
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Anti-Ban Best Practices
1. **Variable Delays**: Random delay between messages
2. **Human-like Patterns**: Different delays per device
3. **Message Variety**: Mix text, images, videos
4. **Gradual Ramp-up**: Start slow with new devices
5. **Monitor Failed**: Track and adjust if high failure rate
