## üìß Message Sequences Feature (Updated June 27, 2025)

### What are Sequences?
Multi-project marketing campaigns with automated message delivery. Each sequence is a project (e.g., "Promo Merdeka", "Promosi Hari Raya") with multi-day templates where each contact maintains their own progress timeline.

### Key Features
1. **Project-Based Campaigns**: Create named marketing projects
2. **Multi-Day Templates**: Define 5+ day message sequences
3. **Individual Progress**: Each lead starts from Day 1 when enrolled
4. **Niche-Based Auto-Enrollment**: Automatically add matching leads
5. **Multiple Active Projects**: Leads can be in multiple sequences
6. **Cross-Device Support**: Works across all user devices
7. **Rate Limiting**: Per-device min/max delays prevent bans
8. **Analytics**: Track success/failure rates per project

### How it Works
1. **Create Project Sequence**: 
   - Name your campaign (e.g., "Promo Merdeka")
   - Set target niche
   - Define daily messages with delays

2. **Lead Enrollment**:
   - Manual: Add specific phone numbers
   - Automatic: All leads matching niche

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Each lead maintains individual timeline
   - Ali: Day 3 of "Promo Merdeka", Day 1 of "Hari Raya"
   - New leads always start at Day 1

4. **Message Delivery**:
   - Daily processing at scheduled times
   - Random delays between messages
   - Next day = 24 hours after previous

### Example Projects

**Promo Merdeka Sequence** (5 days):
```
Day 1: Selamat Hari Merdeka! Special 17% discount... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 2: Flash sale continues! Check our products... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 3: Customer testimonials from last year... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 4: Only 2 days left for Merdeka promo... [10-20 sec delay]
Day 5: Last day! Promo ends at midnight... [10-20 sec delay]
```

**Promosi Hari Raya Sequence** (7 days):
```
Day 1: Ramadan Kareem! Early bird Raya collection... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 2: New arrivals for your Raya celebration... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 3: Exclusive designs now available... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 4: Free delivery for orders above RM100... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 5: Limited stock warning - popular items... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 6: Final week before Raya - order now... [15-30 sec delay]
Day 7: Express delivery still available! [15-30 sec delay]
```

## üöÄ Broadcast System Architecture

### Optimized for 200 Users √ó 15 Devices = 3,000+ Connections

### User Isolation & Multi-Device Distribution
- **Complete User Isolation**: Each user's campaigns and sequences ONLY use their own connected devices
- **Example**: 
  - User A creates "Promo Merdeka" campaign ‚Üí Uses ONLY User A's 15 connected devices
  - User B creates "Hari Raya" campaign ‚Üí Uses ONLY User B's 15 connected devices
  - No cross-user device sharing for security and privacy
- **Automatic Load Balancing**: Messages are distributed across all user's connected devices
- **Device Selection**: Round-robin or random selection from user's device pool
- **Failover**: If some devices disconnect, system automatically uses remaining connected devices

### Campaign & Sequence Triggers
- **Campaign Triggers**: Run every minute to check for scheduled campaigns
  - Checks campaign date and time
  - Gets all leads matching campaign niche
  - Distributes messages across ALL user's connected devices
  - Updates campaign status to "sent" when complete
- **Sequence Triggers**: Process new leads and daily messages
  - Auto-enrolls new leads based on niche matching
  - Sends daily messages at scheduled times
  - Each contact progresses individually through sequence

### Device Workers
- **Individual Workers**: Each device runs its own message worker
- **Parallel Processing**: Up to 100 concurrent workers system-wide
- **Custom Rate Limiting**: Each device has min/max delay settings
- **Queue Management**: 1000 message buffer per device
- **Health Monitoring**: Auto-restart stuck workers

### Message Flow
1. **Campaign/Sequence Trigger** ‚Üí Message created in database
2. **Broadcast Manager** ‚Üí Routes message to appropriate device worker
3. **Device Worker** ‚Üí Queues message with rate limiting
4. **WhatsApp Send** ‚Üí Message sent with random delay
5. **Status Update** ‚Üí Database updated with result

### Performance Features
- **Sharded Architecture**: Distributes load across devices
- **Message Buffering**: Prevents overwhelming WhatsApp
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database usage
- **In-Memory Queues**: Fast message processing
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed messages retry with backoff

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```
Per Device Settings:
- Min Delay: 5-10 seconds (configurable)
- Max Delay: 15-30 seconds (configurable)
- Random delay between min/max for each message
- Prevents pattern detection and bans
```

### Scaling Guidelines
- **Small (< 500 devices)**: 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- **Medium (500-2000 devices)**: 4GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
- **Large (2000-5000 devices)**: 8GB RAM, 8 CPU cores
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Anti-Ban Best Practices
1. **Variable Delays**: Random delay between messages
2. **Human-like Patterns**: Different delays per device
3. **Message Variety**: Mix text, images, videos
4. **Gradual Ramp-up**: Start slow with new devices
5. **Monitor Failed**: Track and adjust if high failure rate

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Sequences

1. **Create a Project Sequence**
   - Navigate to Sequences tab
   - Click "Create New Sequence"
   - Name your project (e.g., "Promo Merdeka")
   - Set target niche
   - Add daily messages with delays

2. **Add Contacts**

   POST /api/sequences/{id}/contacts
   {
     "contacts": ["+60123456789", "+60987654321"]
   }
   ```

3. **Auto-Enrollment**
   - All leads with matching niche auto-enrolled
   - Processed every minute by background worker

### Broadcast Optimization

1. **Device Configuration**
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_devices 
   SET min_delay_seconds = 10, max_delay_seconds = 30 
   WHERE id = 'device-id';
   ```

2. **Monitor Workers**
   - Check `/api/broadcast/stats` for worker status
   - Auto-restart on failure
   - Health checks every 30 seconds

### Campaign Automation

1. **Schedule Campaign**
   - Set date and time in campaign calendar
   - Assign device and niche
   - System auto-sends at scheduled time

2. **Track Progress**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Message delivery tracking
   - Failed message retry

## üìà Scaling Guidelines

### For 200 Users √ó 15 Devices (3,000 Total Devices):

#### System Requirements:
1. **Server Specs**:
   - **CPU**: 8+ cores (16 recommended)
   - **RAM**: 16GB minimum (32GB recommended)
   - **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD for message history
   - **Network**: 1Gbps+ connection

2. **Database** (PostgreSQL):
   - Connection pool: 200-300 connections
   - Shared buffers: 4GB+
   - Effective cache: 12GB+
   - Max connections: 500

3. **Broadcast Manager Settings**:
   - Max workers: 100-200 concurrent
   - Queue buffer: 1000 messages per device
   - Health check: Every 30 seconds
   - Worker restart: After 10 min inactivity

#### Performance Expectations:
- **Message Throughput**: 
  - Per device: 10-20 messages/minute (with delays)
  - System total: 30,000-60,000 messages/minute
- **Campaign Distribution**:
  - 10,000 contacts campaign: 3-5 minutes across 15 devices
  - 100,000 contacts campaign: 30-50 minutes
- **Memory Usage**:
  - Per device worker: 50-100MB
  - Total for 3,000 devices: 150-300GB (workers cycle, not all active)

### User Isolation Example:
```
User A (15 devices) ‚Üí Campaign "Promo A" ‚Üí 50,000 contacts
- Device A1: 3,333 messages
- Device A2: 3,333 messages
- ... (distributed across all 15 devices)

User B (15 devices) ‚Üí Campaign "Promo B" ‚Üí 30,000 contacts
- Device B1: 2,000 messages
- Device B2: 2,000 messages
- ... (distributed across all 15 devices)

Both campaigns run simultaneously without interference!
```

### Performance Tuning:
- Adjust `maxWorkers` in broadcast manager (default: 100)
- Configure message queue buffer size (default: 1000)
- Set appropriate delay ranges per device type
- Monitor and adjust based on WhatsApp response

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Import Cycle Error**: Fixed by moving types to domain layer
2. **Worker Stuck**: Auto-restart after 10 minutes of inactivity
3. **Queue Full**: Increase buffer size or add more workers
4. **High Ban Rate**: Increase delay settings, reduce concurrent messages

**Support**: Create an issue on GitHub for help!
